The dataset link is provided in the problem statement. 
The code best works on colab, as it gives free gpu service, so 20 epochs took 35 minutes, you can increase it, on 10 epochs it showed 59 % accuracy, on 20 it showd 69 %, further changes can be made to see model accuracy.
Further recommendations could include improving the model parameters to increase its performance.
